# COMP496_Group11_Project
This Github holds all the scrips for our Project Escape The Museum. Since our project is in Unity, and is over 7 GB's we will just upload the code and other important files we see fit. When we finish the project we will upload a a google drive link so that the game can be downloaded! We have a Windows Build and a Mac Build of the game. The Game can be found inside the "Escape the Museum Builds" folder and from you you can either download the Windows or Mac build of the game. There are also installation instructions and a user tutorial for additonal instructions on how to play!
